                Before lunch several of the passengers organized a pool, which could not fail to please those fond of
                betting and gambling. The result of this pool was not to be known for four days; it was what is called
                the 'pilot's pool.' When a ship arrives at the land-falls every one knows that a pilot comes on board;
                so they divide the twenty-four hours
                of the day and night into forty-eight half-hours
